			<p>I'm Sam a New Jersey native dreaming of Cali living.  I graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in Advertising and Marketing Communications.  I have worked in the fashion industry, music, sports & entertainment and am currently working in hospitality.  So you can say I'm pretty well rounded when it comes to all areas of marketing.  I recently acquired some new tech skills and will hopefully start working more in the digital world with endless opportunities of creativity.</p>

			<p>In my spare time I stay active, as I am a certified Personal Trainer and Spinning Instructor.  I've completed two Tough Mudders, my first Half Marathon and love snowboarding.</p>

			<p>Overall, I'm a hippie at heart who loves to get creative and crafty & I very much enjoy reading, gardening, cooking & playing with puppies.....and you can most likely find me at the beach.</p>
