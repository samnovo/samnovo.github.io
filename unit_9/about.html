			<p>A little background info:</p>

			<p>When I was younger I dreamed of writing for a fashion magazine and eventually becoming a designer. So, naturally I went to the Fashion Institute of Technology with every intention of working at a fashion house.  I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Advertising & Marketing Communications and wanted nothing more than to work in entertainment & sports.  The fashion guru turned football fanatic! I started working for the NY Jets right out of college and had some truley amazing experiences.</p>

			<p>In my spare time I enjoy staying active, DIYing, trying new things and challenging myself.  I've completed two Tough Mudders, my first Half Marathon and in the future would love to become a yoga instructor.  Since moving to CA I've become more of a hiker, paddle boarder, surfer newbie and trying everything and anything outdoors.</p>

			<p>Overall, I'm a hippie at heart who loves to get creative and crafty & I very much enjoy reading, gardening, cooking & playing with puppies.....you can most likely find me at the beach.</p>
