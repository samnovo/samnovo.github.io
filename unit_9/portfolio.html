			<p>The photos provided are just an examples of some of the print marketing projects I have created while working for Morris County Golf Club.  Over the last two years I have handled all aspects of marketing and communications for the Club.  My greatest accomplishment while working for MCGC was transition the Club's website.  It was a huge undertaking but in the end the impact it had on the membership was worth the all the hard work.  The transition made the site much more user friendly and gave the members the ability to have everything at their fingertips.  Along with the site transition I worked with a team to create a mobile app that mirrored the Club's website.  After the website change and debut of the app the membershup usage increased and that was the overall goal of this transition. To prepare myself for this project I enrolled in an HTML, CSS and Web Design course leading up to the transition of the site.  Signing up for that class was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  It was not only beyond helpful but I learned I had a passion for learning and writing code; the realm of creativity became endless. </p>

			<p>Other projects I worked on while at MCGC included: monthly calendar postcards, newsletters, seasonal mangazines, promotional pieces for dining, racquets and golf events, junior program brochures, women and men's golf booklets and the membership directory.  This project is my largest print piece of the year and this past year I transfered the project from Quark to InDesign. </p>
